There are four versions of the SortFastq program:

SortFastq1 implements the insertion sort algorithm 
SortFastq2 implements quicksort with Lomuto partition choosing the last element as pivot
SortFastq3 implements quicksort with modified Hoare partition choosing the last element as pivot
SortFastq4 implements quicksort with modified Hoare partition choosing "median of three" as pivot to avoid the worst-case scenario

When comparing the speed of your program to mine use SortFastq4
